Student Management System Project

Welcome to the Student Management System project!

As I embark on my journey of learning and mastering C++, I am thrilled to present this simple yet classic project that I have been diligently working on. This project, the Student Management System, is a testament to my dedication to honing my skills in C++ programming.

The Student Management System is still a work in progress, but it already showcases a myriad of functionalities. Through this project, a teacher or administrator can efficiently perform basic operations to manipulate student records stored in files.

Throughout the development of this project, I have delved into various fundamental concepts of C++. I have gained invaluable insights into the usage of raw pointers, references, classes and objects, constructors (both default and parameterized), and file operations (including reading, writing, updating, and deleting data). Additionally, I have explored the nuances of header files, implementation files, code management, and memory management.

With each line of code, I have expanded my understanding and proficiency in C++. However, my journey does not end here. In the next phase of my learning journey, I am eager to delve deeper into advanced topics such as templates, smart pointers, STL (Standard Template Library), serialization, deserialization, the Strings class, and more.
